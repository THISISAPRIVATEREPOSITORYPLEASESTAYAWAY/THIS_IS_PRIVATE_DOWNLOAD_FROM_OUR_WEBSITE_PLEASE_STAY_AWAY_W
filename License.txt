You are responsible for adhering to any limitations, terms, or data restrictions set by these third-party services.

17. Software Nature and Data Control

Subtitle Sphere is primarily an offline software that operates on the user's local system. The majority of its functions, including audio & video transcription and subtitling, are performed entirely on the user's device without any data transmission. Internet connectivity is only required for specific features such as translation, Google transcription, and SRT generation from plain text file, which utilize third-party services (Google Translate, Google Speech Recognition, and Google Text-to-Speech).

When using these online features:

Data is transmitted directly from the user's device to the third-party service providers without passing through Subtitle Sphere's servers.
Users maintain full control over when and what data is transmitted to these third-party services.
Users are responsible for ensuring their use of these third-party services complies with the respective terms of service and data policies.
Subtitle Sphere is currently offered as a free software for both personal and professional use. However, we reserve the right to modify our licensing terms, including the potential introduction of paid features or commercial licensing requirements, in the future. Any such changes will be communicated to users and will not affect the core offline functionality of the software.

21. Data Collection for Software Download Policy

By requesting the software through our survey, you agree to the following data collection policy:

Purpose of Data Collection: When you submit the anonymous download survey, the hosting platform automatically collects your IP address for security purposes.

IP Address Collection and Retention: The IP address is only retained if unusual behavior is detected (e.g., multiple form submissions, spamming, fake entries). Otherwise, it is deleted after a period of routine security monitoring.
Data Retention and Removal: If no suspicious activity is associated with an IP address, it is removed after security checks are completed.
Commitment to Privacy: We respect your privacy and ensure that survey responses remain anonymous. We do not share or sell any collected data under any circumstances.
